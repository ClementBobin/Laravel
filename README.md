## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

## DEV environnement

1. Open the Project in GitHub Codespaces

    Go to the GitHub repository.
    Click on the "Code" button and select "Open with Codespaces".
    Wait for the Codespace to initialize. Once it's up and running, you will be inside the VS Code environment inside GitHub Codespaces.

2. Launch setup script

```bash
bash infra/setup.sh
```

Run the tests using the following command:

```bash
npm run build
php artisan test
```

The test results will be displayed in the terminal.

To launch the framework in dev Mode:

```bash
npm run build
php artisan serve
```

    Stopping Docker

When you're done working with the container, you can stop it with:

```baash
docker-compose down
```

This will stop and remove the container and also deleted all data from db.
